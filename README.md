# Project-Euler-
A collection of my solutions to problems from the Project Euler archive. Project Euler is an online collection of applied mathematics problems designed to be solved using knowledge of computer programming and mathematics.
This is made mainly to demonstrate my skill for employers. For non-employers, take care not to look at solutions for problems you have not solved so you don't spoil the solution.
Note that my solutions here are developed only to the level required to solve the problem, and I did not attempt to make them polished or to improve their readibilty beyond what was needed while working on the problem. I hold myself to a higher standard when making code for continual or collaborative use.
