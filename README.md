# Project-Euler-
A collection of my solutions to problems from the Project Euler archive. This is made mainly to demonstrate my skill for employers. For non-employers, take care not to look at solutions for problems you have not solved so you don't spoil the solution
Note that my solutions here are developed only to the level required to solve the problem, and I did not attempt to make them polished to readable. I hold myself to a higher standard when making code for continual or collaborative use.
